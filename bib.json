  {"id":"BackePlayingIdentityAuthors2019","abstract":"This article offers a comparative analysis of Davey Wreden’s The Stanley Parable (Wreden 2011 / Galactic Cafe 2013) and The Beginner’s Guide (Everything Unlimited Ltd. 2015) in order to explore the interrelation of authors, narrators, avatars, and players as four salient functions in the play with identity that videogames afford. Building on theories of collective and collaborative authorship, of narratives and narrators across media, and of the avatar-player relationship, the article reconstructs the similarities and differences between the way in which The Stanley Parable and The Beginner’s Guide position their players in relation to the two games’ avatars, narrators, and (main) author, while also underscoring how both The Stanley Parable and The Beginner’s Guide use metareferential strategies to undermine any overly rigid conceptualization of these functions and their interrelation.","author":[{"family":"Backe","given":"Hans-Joachim"},{"family":"Thon","given":"Jan-Noël"}],"citation-key":"BackePlayingIdentityAuthors2019","container-title":"Diegesis","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,13]]},"language":"en","note":"Narration and Digital Identity.

  {"id":"BoutangMutationsContemporaryUrban2010","abstract":"Cognitive architecture questions how evolving modalities - from biopolitics to noopolitics - can be mapped upon the city under contemporary conditions of urbanization and globalization. Noopolitics, most broadly understood as a power exerted over the life of the mind, re-configures perception, memory and attention, and also implicates potential ways and means by which neurobiological architecture is undergoing reconfigurations. This volume, motivated by theories such as 'cognitive capitalism' and concepts such as 'neural plasticity', shows how architecture and urban processes and products commingle to form complex systems that produce novel forms of networks that empower the imagination and constitute the cultural landscape. This volume rethinks the relations between form and forms of communication, calling for a new logic of representation; it examines the manner in which information, with its non-hierarchical and distributed format is contributing both to the sculpting of brain and production of mind.","author":[{"family":"Boutang","given":"Yan Moulier"}],"call-number":"NA2543.S46 C64 2010","citation-key":"BoutangMutationsContemporaryUrban2010","collection-number":"6","collection-title":"Delft School of Design series on architecture and urbanism","container-title":"Cognitive architecture: from bio-politics to noo-politics ; architecture & mind in the age of communication and information","editor":[{"family":"Hauptmann","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Neidich","given":"Warren"}],"event-place":"Rotterdam","ISBN":"978-90-6450-725-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"note":"OCLC: ocn702610443","page":"454–468","publisher":"010 Publishers","publisher-place":"Rotterdam","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Mutations in Contemporary Urban Space and the Cognitive Turning Point of Capitalism","title-short":"Cognitive architecture","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"CitarellaActuallyExistingAccidental2021","abstract":"312 Likes, 4 Comments - Joshua Citarella (@joshuacitarella) on Instagram: \"Actually Existing Accidental Megastructure\nWritten by @ismargohere \nRead by @holly_herndon \n\nA.E.A.M. is a pseudo-ironic term first used by Michael S. Pepinski, the domestic terrorist and literary critic, in his manifesto Against Planetary Domestication: Where and When. It is repeated often by his ideological allies and many critics. An “Accidental Megastructure,” from Christopher Cratchen’s book The Tubes, is a platform composed of different scales of computing technology that resembles a multi-level network architecture stack. Cratchen is critical of the current form of this technical and institutional model, but suggests that this structure can be improved.\n\nThe phrase “Actually-Existing,” from the much-satirized catchphrase Actually-Existing Socialism (see Real Socialism), is used to mock proponents of alternative planetary scale governance models, suggesting that the only possible manifestations of their theory are the deeply flawed stacks they critique.\n\nContents of the Manifesto\n\nAgainst Planetary Domestication starts with Pepinski’s claim: \"Disastrously, many hope that the final consequence of the digital revolution will be the dissolution of the human race.\" Pepinski argues that most people spend their time performing “self- destroying tasks” subliminally demanded by platforms’ designs and incentives; he calls these \"administered desires,\" a category which includes the desires to hold a low-paying and high- output media jobs, to consume artificial or insect-based meat substitutes, and to court the attention of digitally enhanced softcore-pornstars and/or political influencers.\nPepinski argues that the dissolution of human novelty is a natural product of a digital, multilayer system because \"the system has to anticipate human behavior perfectly in order to function,” and that reform of the system isn’t desirable, as a planetary platform with looser restrictions will still track and necessarily anticipate all behavior. He states that the task of those who oppose all accidental and intentional megastructures is to cultivate physical and intellectual strength and perform absurd, one of a kind actions in order to thwart models and algorithms.\"","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Citarella","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Gohere","given":"Ismar"}],"citation-key":"CitarellaActuallyExistingAccidental2021","container-title":"@joshuacitarella","genre":"Instagram post","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]]},"language":"en","title":"Actually Existing Accidental Megastructure","title-short":"Joshua Citarella on Instagram","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRZp1E8Ls6S/"},
