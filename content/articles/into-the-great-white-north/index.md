You’ve been consumed by Cyclonopedia.

> The plane of the Thing is characterized by lack of any cognition about the self despite total control from first or third person perspectives, dissociative fugue syndrome, mirroring and the total immersion of player or reader into the Ludicosm or the game-space. (244)

You close your book on page 244 and turn toward quiet reflection. Since first reading the Cyclonopedia you’ve looked at the world in two’s. These infernal dichotomies haunt society, and you see them all around you. There is a central pairing underlining Cyclonopedia: Petroleum and Sun. These are traced into Solar Capitalism and the Tellurian Insider, equal forces of life and unlife, for which you find parallel everywhere. Techno-capitalists and Jihadists. Reason and the passions of the body. Good and evil, an infernal dichotomy if there ever was one. Man and Woman tracks you through the recess of all culture. Cyclonopedia posits the tellurian insider as sentient. Oil is alive. Oil is nectorized matter, the mass of all death, that has been harnessed to create mechanistic un-life.

Stretching, and feeling your own body shiver in the face of a local chill, you exit the damp cabin through a hatch, up and above a squat wooden step, three-quarter-ways up the back wall, and on to the deck of a low slung vessel. You stand unsteadily on the Isle Mist watching the ocean and the snow capped mountains in the distance.

You chartered this retired fishing vessel to take you from Akutan, a remote Aleutian Island of the Alaskan peninsula, and up through the Bering Sea, on to the Bering straight and into the Chukchi Sea, a marginal and relatively inaccessible annex of the Arctic Ocean. Akutan once housed a successful fishing town but after mismanagement of the local cannery and some light embezzling, the lifeblood of the economy was drained. Almost everyone on the island had supported themselves through the fishing industry, and it had been that way for generations. After the collapse, many moved away. Winters were longer and darker, and the people that remained in Akutan felt more alone than usual. They would still fish at the same sites, but with no buyers the entire harvest would be refrigerated for winter. Those that remained were convinced a new cannery would open. If the fish were there, someone would buy them. But after two years even the locals would tell you that Akutan had fallen into decay. This strange outpost that had survived against all odds was finally corrupted by Greed, and it morphed into a den of gamblers, drunks, and opiate-abusers. The locals watched, helpless and destitute.

After four years a new cannery was opened on Akutan. The already small town had shrunk significantly after its downturn, and the fishing fleet had maybe ten active permits left. So while the new cannery was small, it still bought everything the remaining fishermen could sell. The people of Akutan rejoiced at their good fortune.

The cannery was run by an international conglomerate called the Ahriman Corporation. The locals didn’t know if the backing money came from Russia, Japan, China, America, or what, but the fisherman spread rumors like flies. Still, as they all tentatively worked for the Ahriman Corporation, or the AC as it was called locally, the gossip was always whispered, and it never led to anything conclusive. Most were just happy to get paid for their work again.

Akutan became a sort of pullman town, like many remote fishing villages. The Ahriman Company employed everyone in town, except the bus driver and the school teacher, and it operated the only store. The AC store stocked fishing gear, food, and a small collection of DVD’s which could all be purchased on credit, against the collateral of the next season’s catch. As such, the people of Akutan were caught in a strange symbiosis with the AC company. They all understood that their labor was being exploited and that the vast majority of profits left the island, but the rugged individualism of the wild west had gone out the window when the AC started paying. During the dark years, the lounge was often alight with big talk of opening a collectively operated cannery, but now fisherman drank quietly in separate corners while a dark contentment surrounded them. Those who had stayed surely wouldn’t leave now. They had been through the worst of it, they all agreed. It should have been hard to find a skipper to take you so far north.
