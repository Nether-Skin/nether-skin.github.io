The following essay intends to address the idea of a ‘radical discontinuity’ appearing in philosopher Reza Negarestani’s development from an early theory-fictional oriented work represented in Cyclonopedia (2008), to the recent synthesis of continental and contemporary analytical philosophical perspectives found in Intelligence and Spirit (2018). With this in mind, the idea of such a ‘radical discontinuity’ in Negarestani’s work will be contested by proposing a possible continuum in Negarestani’s writing between Cyclonopedia and Intelligence and Spirit found in the explicit and implicit utilization of concepts such as: ‘the inhuman’ and ‘the Outside’. The ubiquity of these concepts will be considered as a potential bridge between Negarestani’s body of work and the philosophical concerns of what has recently been known as ‘neorationalism’ (Trafford and Wolfendale, 2019, p. 7-9). In other words, the aforementioned concepts will be seen as vectors which ostensibly show a persistent concern in Negarestani’s thought around the possibilities afforded by speculative thought and the manifestation of counterfactual entities and objects that complexify and dislocate the givenness of what we firmly take to be (as human subjects) our sensible perception of the world and in turn, the concepts we elaborate about such perceptions.

## I. The unmaking of foundational subjectivity
In order to bridge the apparent dissimilarity in-between Reza Negarestani’s past and present work, we will first need to highlight what seems to be the overarching tenet of his overall project, which can be broadly put as the “effectuation or imposition of impossibility”  {{< cite "NegarestaniCyclonopediacomplicityanonymous2008" 200 >}}. This claim might seem too abstract at first, but the purpose of this essay will consist in grounding this underlying tenet by reviewing a series of concepts and means that seem to function in Negarestani’s writings as productive catalysts that make such effectuation or imposition a recurring problem. Namely, the selected concepts and means explored in this essay will be seen as connectors between the bundle of tangled narratives developed throughout *Cyclonopedia* and the philosophical project proposed in Intelligence and Spirit. Now that we have briefly drafted the problem present at hand, we’ll proceed to unravel what exactly the ends and means swiveling around this tenet are by posing the following question: is there a concept being problematized at hand by Negarestani throughout his work as to delimit a way toward what he calls effectuation or imposition of the impossible? If there is a concept being problematized, what role does it play on what Reza has vaguely called the effectuation of impossibility? What does impossibility mean within the context of Negarestani’s body of work?
To respond to these questions, we would need to take in mind that Negarestani consistently directs strategic assaults against foundational subjectivity in order to invoke the aforementioned tenet, thus

making foundational subjectivity one of the concepts being problematized at large. Following this argument, foundational subjectivity should be defined as the dubious idea of conceiving a fixed or immutable human identity/nature.[^1] However, we should be warned that the mentioned assault on foundational subjectivity is not a nihilistic proposal that necessarily builds up toward the annihilation of self, and should rather be considered as the enablement of a series of rigorous and law-like destabilizations of what we take to be our given human identity so we, as human subjects, are able to question our own status as defined by a set of rigid descriptors under such-and-such conditions -be it constraints by law of what it means to be a human subject under a the western point-of-view i.e. the entitlement of the “right” to consider oneself human/the belonging to a universal “human condition” that follows a hegemonic conception of what the human subject should be2, or according to a set of physico-chemical conditionings that have invariably given rise to our human sentience and sapience3-, in order to shift our own self-conception to one that consists of being an open vessel that is under continual but not ungrounded self-modification, questioning any kind of rigid descriptors of what the human should be. In turn, this shifting of an apparently invariant perspective can give-shape and concretely manifest the new or the yet-unseen by opening the gate to the relentless influx and saturation of contradistinctive conceptual, material and practical data that threatens to haphazardly modify our current world perspectives into something that becomes profoundly alien to itself, but that is nevertheless tractable or legible in its own process of becoming. This opening of the gate to data which is yet-to-be-decrypted and that has the capability of infecting and then disintegrating our own sense of stability as human subjects can be translated as what Negarestani calls the Outside: that is to say, alien data that crashes upon us (as apparently constituted human subjects), violently eroding what we have taken ourselves to be:
> Everything excitingly schizoid, capable of attracting the merciless invasion of xeno- particles and igniting criminal excitations, happens on the borders of identity and its regimes which balefully put up their resistance against any malicious force. In order to draw schizo-lines of communication from the Outside, a rigorous course for dismantling identity is necessary, yet any serious attempt for total eradication of identity intrinsically excludes the space of xeno-excitations and ends up in autistic nihilism {{< cite "NegarestaniCyclonopediacomplicityanonymous2008" 119 >}}.

By highlighting the quote above, we reiterate that Negarestani looks to go beyond an intractable and unproductive erasure of subjectivity as the representation of an abstract human essence, and rather looks toward a constructive exploration found at the edge or limit of such subjectivity in order to unmake it by turning it into a prey for the Outside. Put into less muddled words, any subjectivity that adamantly upholds self-redundancy eventually becomes the artifact of a paranoid rule


[^1]: “Nature is not a block of wax ready to be molded, nor is it fixed or stable. It offers the greatest forms of resistance and its parametric space enlarges as we begin to scrutinize it or intervene in it. The global projection of detected local regularities of phenomena becomes less and less straightforward, and topologically nontrivial. As our cognitive access extends to new sectors of natural phenomena, the principle of inductive simplicity that globally projects local regularities becomes ever more fragile (...) The loss of innocence, comfort, and simplicity, both theoretical and practical, is the unavoidable price we have to pay for both the complexification of our cognitive access to nature and our uncovering of the complexity of nature” (Negarestani, 2018, p. 122)
