Pepinski, the domestic terrorist and literary critic, in his manifesto Against Planetary Domestication: Where and When. It is repeated often by his ideological allies and many critics. An “Accidental Megastructure,” from Christopher Cratchen’s book The Tubes, is a platform composed of different scales of computing technology that resembles a multi-level network architecture stack. Cratchen is critical of the current form of this technical and institutional model, but suggests that this structure can be improved.\n\nThe phrase “Actually-Existing,” from the much-satirized catchphrase Actually-Existing Socialism (see Real Socialism), is used to mock proponents of alternative planetary scale governance models, suggesting that the only possible manifestations of their theory are the deeply flawed stacks they critique.\n\nContents of the Manifesto\n\nAgainst Planetary Domestication starts with Pepinski’s claim: \"Disastrously, many hope that the final consequence of the digital revolution will be the dissolution of the human race.\" Pepinski argues that most people spend their time performing “self- destroying tasks” subliminally demanded by platforms’ designs and incentives; he calls these \"administered desires,\" a category which includes the desires to hold a low-paying and high- output media jobs, to consume artificial or insect-based meat substitutes, and to court the attention of digitally enhanced softcore-pornstars and/or political influencers.\nPepinski argues that the dissolution of human novelty is a natural product of a digital, multilayer system because \"the system has to anticipate human behavior perfectly in order to function,” and that reform of the system isn’t desirable, as a planetary platform with looser restrictions will still track and necessarily anticipate all behavior. He states that the task of those who oppose all accidental and intentional megastructures is to cultivate physical and intellectual strength and perform absurd, one of a kind actions in order to thwart models and algorithms.\"",
