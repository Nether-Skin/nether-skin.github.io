Closed-source city</h2><p>In Paris, in the subway, feeling a new skin. In the RER too. This station has been completely rebuilt since last time, but they haven&rsquo;t managed to get rid of that sewage smell. The underground remains disturbing, even with the new walls. Trapped under the earth‘s surface, carried away by flows of people, running under artificial lights.</p><p>Old water drainage marks, pixelated skies of cheesy ads for Irish whisky and one-eyed screens on the walls. Directions, so many directions. Hypersignalized maze of stairs, tunnels and destinations. Interconnected voids filled with words, clocks and signs. How many levels between the surface of the city and the depths of it‘s underground?</p><p>Thinking about Nexus. The echo of rumbling subways crosses the galleries. Metallic highs of brakes freeze my eardrums. My train is at the platform. I take a sit next to the window in the direction of travel. The train takes off; feeling moved faster and faster.</p></section></article></div><p class="footer text-center">Copyright (c) 2023 John Doe</p></body></html>
