Telling of a future beyond the reach of fear. Scroll of Avacyn</p></blockquote><p>First things first: It is not this essay’s mission to discredit, harm, or conjure up the demise of any authors, as suggested (and done) by writers before me. An example: In <em>The Death of the Author</em> (1967),1 Roland Barthes strongly condemns the oversaturated presence of authors in their work, proclaiming that writing inevitably becomes irreducible to the person(s) it was produced by. Consequently, for Barthes, “the author enters his [sic] own death”.2
Like many Western writers and thinkers of his time, however, Barthes can be accused of having fallen into the trap of hyperbolic expression and false universalisms, grossly overvaluing and generalizing individual and situated experience and knowledge: They attempt to characterize the world but might actually describe Europe, or more specifically white (and most often, male) Europe, or more specifically their respective country of residence, meaning the city they live in, their social surroundings, ultimately outlining little more than their direct interactional and intellectual environment: And while artfully and elegantly declaring dead an acquaintance with whom one shares a certain range of realities and perceptions thereof might seem to be somewhat acceptable, even useful in regards of (literary) rhetoric – and potentially reversible –, proclaiming the death of someone with whom little or no such realities are shared will all too quickly shed a light on the proclaimer’s own observative and reflective limitedness, exposing the megalomania of reading the particular as the universal.3</p></section></article></div><p class="footer text-center">Copyright (c) 2023 John Doe</p></body></html>
