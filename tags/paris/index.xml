Closed-source city In Paris, in the subway, feeling a new skin. In the RER too. This station has been completely rebuilt since last time, but they haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to get rid of that sewage smell. The underground remains disturbing, even with the new walls. Trapped under the earthâ€˜s surface, carried away by flows of people, running under artificial lights.
Old water drainage marks, pixelated skies of cheesy ads for Irish whisky and one-eyed screens on the walls.</description></item></channel></rss>
